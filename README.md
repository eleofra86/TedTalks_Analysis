# TED Talks Analysis

A simple but interesting analysis on TED Talks videos published on TED Talks webite during the years.

## Description

I downloaded this data from Kaggle on Apr, 30th 2022. This is the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/ted-talks?resource=download.

The data has been scraped from the official TED Website by the creator of the dataset (Mr. Ashish Jangra) and was lastly updated in February 2022.

I used this dataset to perform an analysis in Python using different libraries:

+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn
+ Numpy
+ Pandas

The database contains 5440 unique videos and for each one, we have available this data:

+ title - Title of the Talk
+ author - Author of Talk
+ date - Date when the talk took place
+ views - Number of views of the Talk
+ likes - Number of likes of the Talk
+ link - Link of the talk from ted.com

Based on this dataset, I firstly investigated how many videos are created each year.

In addition, I analyzed like and views distributions.

Furthermore, I discovered which is the most popular video, in terms of views and likes.

Lstly, I considered the authors to understand how many authors created videos for TED Talks and if there is someone that created more than 1 video.
